1. Our client Artemis Fincancail desire to give fincancial advince to their customers. Since this involves sensitive inforamtion
   secrurity and encryption are require to earn customers trust. Our client wants to know if the software is up and readly for the tasks
   desire, and if its has any vulnerbility that hackers and attackers could take adventage of.
2. Software protection and security should be a concern for any company that rely on software. Software stores a lot of senistive information
   that could do harm if given in the wrong hands. Secure software ensures that a company or any organization could be trusted. For me doing the dependency
   checks was easly, it was doing the refactoring and finding false positives that was diffcult for me.
3. Identiflying the false positives, that was the greatist issue for me.
4. Making sure that the project has HTTP posts. Also updating the pom.xml to the latist versions, to make the code work better.
5. I try to make sure that there isn't any errors. Re-runing the dependency check was causing problems, it was always having a issue
   either how much I update the pom.xml or whatever errors I fixed.
6. Eclipse externsions such as with java and maven. There was some websites that give decent advice. In the future I make sure to
 get more better information, and try to understand how to use eclipse's features.
7. My SSL certificates and my frist dependency report, displaying that I could run the software.
